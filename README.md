# Achtung, die Kurve! Classic

The classic MS-DOS game *Achtung, die Kurve!* from 1995 in the browser!

Written in Elm by Simon Alling and Simon Lydell.

## Play

Go to [kurve.se](http://kurve.se) (or [kurve.se/legacy](http://kurve.se/legacy) for the legacy JavaScript version).

Fullscreen is recommended for the best experience.

## Contribute

```shell
npm ci
npm start
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

The original MS-DOS game (whose author I haven't been able to determine; see #136) is included for reference.
To launch it, install [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) and then run `dosbox docs/original-game/ZATACKA.EXE`.
