# Achtung, die Kurve! in Elm

The aim of this project is to create an Elm remake of the original *Achtung, die Kurve!* from 1995.

```shell
npm ci
npm run watch
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

## Play

The Elm remake is not yet released, but you can play the legacy JavaScript version.

* **Online:**  Go to [kurve.se](http://kurve.se).
* **Locally:** [Download the game](/SimonAlling/kurve/archive/master.zip) and open `ZATACKA.html` in your browser.

The game will automatically scale itself up as much as possible; fullscreen is recommended for the best experience.
