{-| The purpose of this limit is to prevent unexpected layout breakage caused either by

  - an explicitly defined representation, or
  - a key code that we don't have a human-readable representation for.

7 characters is the maximum in the original game (L.Arrow, D.Arrow, L.Mouse, R.Mouse).

8 characters is the maximum that is guaranteed to fit to the left of "READY" in the lobby of the original game.
