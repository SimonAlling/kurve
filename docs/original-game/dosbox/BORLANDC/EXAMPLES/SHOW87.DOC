       SHOW87 is a memory-resident program that displays the
       entire state of an installed 8087 coprocessor chip when an
       8087 is present. This is useful when you're debugging code
       that contains 8087 instructions.

       SHOW87 has two modes of installation. The default is the
       shell mode in which SHOW87 executes a DOS shell, rather
       than making itself truly resident. This allows you to
       de-install SHOW87 by typing EXIT at any DOS prompt. The
       disadvantage of the shell mode is that a second command
       processor must be invoked, which uses an extra 3,000 to
       4,000 bytes of memory. The other installation mode is the
       resident mode, which is specified by the /R parameter.
       SHOW87 uses less memory in this mode, but cannot be
       removed. SHOW87 alone uses about 5,700 bytes of memory.

       Once installed, SHOW87 can be invoked at any time by
       pressing Alt-7. Invoking SHOW87 causes most of the upper
       half of the screen to display the flags, registers, and
       other information regarding the 8087. Pressing any key
       exits you from the display and restores the screen.
       Normally, you would install SHOW87 before debugging 8087
       code and then remove SHOW87 when it's no longer needed.

       If SHOW87 cannot properly install itself, it will display
       an error message and terminate. The most common reasons
       for such an error are insufficient memory, COMMAND.COM not
       found, or no 80x87 is detected. COMMAND.COM is only needed
       when SHOW87 is run in shell mode. SHOW87 finds the
       COMMAND.COM file by looking for the COMSPEC parameter in
       the environment (see your DOS manual).

       SHOW87 displays all 8087 information, including the
       instruction pointer, the operand pointer, the operation
       code; the control, status, and tag words; the precision,
       rounding, and infinity control settings; the stack top;
       the condition codes and their various interpretations; the
       exception settings and interrupt mask settings; and the
       register values.

       The condition code settings represent C3, C2, C1, and C0
       respectively. The Comp, Test, and Exam fields display the
       meaning of the condition codes as returned by the FCOM,
       FTST, and FXAM instructions.

       Register values are displayed in one of two ways. If the
       number has a tag setting of VALID, the number is displayed
       in decimal format. If the number has a tag setting of
       SPECIAL or EMPTY, a hexadecimal dump of the number is
       displayed. After the mantissa and exponent, the type of
       value (as interpreted by the FXAM instruction) is
       displayed.
