
                          WHEREIS 2.0

  WHEREIS is a utility that searches a disk for files that match
  a user-supplied file specification. The utility performs a
  recursive search through any subdirectories it finds during
  its search. WHEREIS can be given multiple file specifications,
  and will show all files that match any of the given file
  specifications. WHEREIS can also be instructed to perform a
  DOS command on each of the files that is found.

  To search an entire disk for a particular file specification,
  you would execute WHEREIS like this:

    whereis *.asm

  This would search through the entire drive (the current drive)
  and display each instance of a file matching the file
  specification *.asm.

  You can also provide an explicit drive specifier:

    whereis a:\*.asm

  This will search drive A: for all matching files.

  If you don't want to search an entire disk, you can explicitly
  define the path from which to start the recursive search. For
  example,

    whereis c:\borland\tasm\*.asm

  will search for all files matching *.asm in the directory
  c:\borland\tasm and any subdirectories below it.

  You can halt execution of WHEREIS by pressing any key while
  it's running. You will be given a message that execution has
  been interrupted. If you want to pause execution of WHEREIS, press
  the space bar. You will be given a prompt to press the spacebar
  a second time to resume the search.

  If you want to search for several file specifications, just enter
  multiple file specifications on the command line. For example,

    whereis c:\borland\tasm\*.asm *.inc

  will search for all the files matching *.asm or *.inc in the directory
  c:\borland\tasm and any subdirectories below it. Note that only the
  first file specification may contain a drive and path specification.

  If you want to perform a dos command on each file that WHEREIS finds,
  you can give the dos command in delimiters on the command line. Valid
  delimiters are '', "", or []. The dos command should contain one of the
  following variables, that will substitute a given string on the
  command line used for the dos command:

     %1 - Insert full path, filename and extension
     %2 - Filename and extension (no path)
     %3 - Only the path.
     %4 - Only the filename before the extension followed by a .
     %5 - Only the extension, preceeded by a .

  For example,

     whereis *.bak [del %2]

  will delete all .BAK files from your drive.

  Another example is,

     whereis *.asm *.inc [grep -i ideal %2]

  which will search all *.ASM and all *.INC files for the word ideal.

  When the dos command is given, it will be given in the same
  directory that the file was found in. Note that the DOS command
  could also be a call to a batch file. Whatever command, executable,
  or batch file, that is specified should be reachable with the
  current PATH environment variable, or a specific path to the
  executable or batch file should be given within the delimiters.
  Also the command should return to the same directory that it
  was called from.

  Since WHEREIS calls COMMAND.COM to do the work of executing the
  given dos command for each file that is found, performance is
  best if COMMAND.COM is placed in a ram disk and COMSPEC=
  environment variable is updated to point to the new copy of
  COMMAND.COM. For a complete discussion of ram disks and
  how to set the COMSPEC= environment variable please see your
  DOS manual.


                    How to assemble WHEREIS

  In order to assemble WHEREIS, execute the following command on the
  DOS command line:

    make -fwhereis

  This will execute the command-line make utility MAKE.EXE and pass
  it the make file WHEREIS.MAK. For instructions on assembling
  specific modules in the WHEREIS program, see the comments at the
  top of each module.

                  New Turbo Assembler 2.0 Features

  WHEREIS has been rewritten since Turbo Assembler 1.01 to show off
  some of the new features of Turbo Assembler 2.0. The file
  IWHEREIS.ASM has many of the features specially noted. Refer
  to that file for more details.
